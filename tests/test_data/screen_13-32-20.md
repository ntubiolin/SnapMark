## Image Description (VLM)

The image shows a webpage displaying different types of CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) technologies. This is from a website named Business Next (bnex.com.tw), and appears to be an informational page about TSMC's CoWoS. There are visual illustrations and descriptions of three CoWoS types:

1. **CoWoS-S**
   - Diagram shows components labeled "Logic" and "HBM" above a "Substrate."
   - Description: Explains CoWoS-S as the mainstream intermediary board, with cost and material characteristics.

2. **CoWoS-R**
   - Similar visual layout with "Logic" and "HBM" over a "Substrate."
   - Description: Details that CoWoS-R has fewer layers, leading to a lower cost.

3. **CoWoS-L**
   - Another diagram with "Logic" and "HBM" above a "Substrate."
   - Description: Mentions internal interconnection and a combination of multiple HBM quantities for improved performance.

**Sidebar features:**
- Sharing options: LINE, Facebook, and a copy link symbol are present.
- Bookmark option represented by a ribbon icon.

**Top Bar and Window Features:**
- Browser interface with multiple open tabs in Chrome.
- Standard menu items like File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Profiles, and Help.
- Website navigation links: News, Feature Topics, Video News, Expert Columns, Community, Activities, Courses, and Magazine.
- Search icon and login options in the upper right corner.

**Footer Notification:**
- A banner at the bottom discusses a countdown of one week to an event.

This information could be stored in an Excel file with the following columns:

| CoWoS Type | Description                  | Diagram Components                  |
|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| CoWoS-S    | Mainstream intermediary board, material characteristics lead to high cost | HBM, Logic, Substrate              |
| CoWoS-R    | Fewer layers, reduced cost                                  | HBM, Logic, Substrate              |
| CoWoS-L    | Internal interconnection with many HBM for performance enhancement | HBM, Logic, Substrate              |

Additional information about sharing options and website navigation could also be documented separately if necessary.
